# User_input_equation
This is a simple code to allow the user to input whatever symbolic function they want for evaluation. 


The code contains three functions:
1. objective_function_user(): This function allows the user to enter symbolic variables (of any length) and create their own mathematical function using these variables using the standard mathematical notations that are used in python. 
2. exhaustive_search_opt(): This function executes an optimization over a single variable mathematical function for optimization.
3. random_walk_opt(): This function executes an optimization over a single variable mathematical function or multi-variable mathematical function for optimization using random walk algorithm

The code can be run in Jupyter Notebook and will execute all the three functions. The exhaustive_search_opt() and random_walk_opt() use the objective_function_user() for user inputs.
